## C++ sfml 

C++ game/engine build with SFML

It's just a fun project based on a YouTube course - [COMP4300 - Game Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ugbLQlw_VM&t=13s&ab_channel=DaveChurchill) 

Inspired by youtube videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ckoLsD7ZU&t=2993s
COMP4300
This is my realization of the course assignments, I am not a student of this course,
I just watched the video and implemented everything in my own way.
This project is mainly for learning SFML and C++ game dev
